**Project for the school subject SYTD at the HTL Krems**

## Overview

This project concludes a year and half of learning how to build applications with interconnected services in the subject SYTD. There are many technologies that 
will be used but there is a primary focus, which is *Reliable Messaging*.


## Technologies


## Development

For developmental purposes, there will be a description of how to build and run the project. For all of that, there is a docker-compose.yaml, which will serve as a 
primary tool for running the application during development. For further information, see [How to run](docs/RUN.md).

## Queues

For the specification of the queues, see [Contracts](docs/CONTRACTS.md)
